# Understanding the PromQL Query: `sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[1m])) by (instance)`


## **Purpose of the Query**
This PromQL query calculates the **total CPU usage per second** for each instance (server/machine). It sums up all CPU time spent in states **other than idle** over the last 1-minute window.

---

## **Breaking Down the Query Step by Step**
### **1️⃣ `node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}`**
- `node_cpu_seconds_total` is a Prometheus metric that records the total CPU time spent in different modes.
- `{mode!="idle"}` filters out the **idle** mode, meaning we are only counting CPU time that was actively used.
- Other CPU modes that contribute to the total usage include:
  - `user` → Time spent running user-space applications
  - `system` → Time spent running system processes
  - `iowait` → Time spent waiting for disk I/O
  - `irq` and `softirq` → Time spent handling hardware and software interrupts

👉 **This ensures that we only measure the CPU time spent doing actual work.**

---

### **2️⃣ `rate(...[1m])`**
- `rate(...)` calculates the **per-second rate** of change for the selected CPU time values.
- `[1m]` specifies that we are looking at data over the past 1 minute.

#### **Example:**
If a single CPU core spent **30 seconds in user mode** over the last **60 seconds**,
```rate(...)``` would return **0.5 (seconds per second)**, meaning **50% of a CPU core was used.**

---

### **3️⃣ `sum(...) by (instance)`**
- `node_cpu_seconds_total` records CPU time **per core**.
- `sum(...) by (instance)` aggregates the values across all cores in each instance (server).
- This gives us the **total CPU usage across all cores** in the instance.

#### **Example for a 4-core system:**
| Core | CPU Time Used (per second) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Core 1 | 0.4 |
| Core 2 | 0.3 |
| Core 3 | 0.5 |
| Core 4 | 0.6 |

Summing these values:
**Total CPU usage = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.8 cores worth of usage**

👉 This tells us **how many full CPU cores are being used** at a given moment per instance.

---

## **Final Meaning of the Query**
- It tells us **how many CPU cores are being fully utilized per second** for each instance, based on the last 1-minute activity.
- If the result is **8.0** on a **16-core system**, it means **half the system is busy**.
- If the result is **16.0** on a **16-core system**, it means **the CPU is fully utilized**.
- If the result is **20.0** on a **16-core system**, it means **the system is overloaded** (tasks are waiting for CPU time).

---

## **Why Is This Useful?**
✅ Helps monitor **CPU load trends** in real-time.
✅ Can be used for **alerting** (e.g., trigger an alert if CPU usage is above 80% of total cores).
✅ Helps in **scaling decisions** (e.g., adding more CPU resources if usage is consistently high).

---

## **Example Alert Rule** (Trigger an alert if CPU usage exceeds 85% of available cores)
```promql
(sum(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[1m])) by (instance))
  / count(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}) by (instance) * 100 > 85
```

This rule calculates **CPU usage as a percentage of total available CPU cores** and triggers an alert if it goes beyond **85% usage**.
