Configuring and Monitoring Data Retention in Prometheus
Prometheus is a robust open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. Effective data retention management is crucial to ensure that Prometheus operates efficiently without consuming excessive storage resources. This document provides a comprehensive guide on configuring and monitoring data retention settings in Prometheus.​

Understanding Data Retention in Prometheus
Prometheus stores time-series data in its Time Series Database (TSDB). Managing the retention of this data is vital to balance between historical data availability and storage constraints. Prometheus offers two primary mechanisms for data retention:​

Time-Based Retention (--storage.tsdb.retention.time): Specifies the duration for which data is retained. The default retention period is 15 days. ​

Size-Based Retention (--storage.tsdb.retention.size): Defines the maximum storage size for data blocks. Once this limit is reached, Prometheus will remove the oldest data to accommodate new data. ​

When both retention policies are set, Prometheus will enforce data deletion based on whichever limit is reached first.​

Configuring Data Retention Policies
To configure data retention settings, you need to modify Prometheus's startup parameters. This can be achieved by   ing the Prometheus service file or the startup command.​

Modifying the Prometheus Service File
If Prometheus is managed as a systemd service, follow these steps:​

Locate the Service File: The Prometheus service file is typically located at /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service or /lib/systemd/system/prometheus.service.​

   the Service File: Open the service file with a text   or:​

  
 
  
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
Update the ExecStart Directive: Modify the ExecStart line to include the retention flags:​

ini
 
  
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path=/var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.size=50GB \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
Ensure that the paths and options match your installation.

Reload and Restart Prometheus: After saving the changes, reload the systemd daemon and restart Prometheus:​

  
 
  
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
Modifying the Prometheus Startup Command
If you're starting Prometheus manually or via a custom script, include the retention flags in the startup command:​

  
 
  
./prometheus \
  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.size=50GB
Adjust the paths and options as per your setup.​

Using Environment Files
Some systems use environment files to manage service options. If your Prometheus service file references an environment file (e.g., /etc/default/prometheus or /etc/sysconfig/prometheus), you can add the retention settings there:​

   the Environment File: Open the environment file:​

sudo nano /etc/default/prometheus
Or:

sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/prometheus
Add Retention Settings: Add or modify the ARGS or STORAGE_RETENTION variable:​
  
ARGS="--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d --storage.tsdb.retention.size=50GB"
Or:
  
STORAGE_RETENTION="--storage.tsdb.retention.time=30d --storage.tsdb.retention.size=50GB"
Restart Prometheus: After saving the changes, restart Prometheus:​
 
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
Verifying Current Data Retention Settings
To check the current data retention settings of your Prometheus instance:​

Access the Prometheus Status Page: Navigate to the status page of your Prometheus server by visiting:​


http://<your-prometheus-server>:9090/status
Replace <your-prometheus-server> with the actual hostname or IP address of your Prometheus server.

Locate Retention Settings: On the status page, look for the "Storage Retention" section. Here, you'll find details about your current retention configurations, including:​

Time-Based Retention (--storage.tsdb.retention.time): Specifies how long data is retained (e.g., 30 days).​

Size-Based Retention (--storage.tsdb.retention.size): Defines the maximum storage size for data retention (e.g., 50GB).​



These settings determine how long and how much data Prometheus retains before purging old data.

Important Considerations
Retention Policy Priority: When both time-based and size-based retention policies are set, Prometheus willdelete data based on whichever limit is reached first. ​

Storage Capacity Planning: Ensure that your storage infrastructure can handle the configured retention settings. Longer retention periods and larger size limits require more disk space.​
